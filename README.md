# Unity Spring Boot API Integration

This Unity project is designed to integrate seamlessly with the Spring Boot application to manage users and weapons. It allows you to interact with data such as user statistics and weapon stats from within the Unity game.

## Features:

- **User Management**: Retrieve and manage user data (level, experience, gold, etc.).
- **Weapon Management**: Retrieve, update, and manage weapon attributes like damage and cooldown.
- **API Integration**: The Unity project interacts with the Spring Boot RESTful APIs for updates and manipulation of user and weapon data.
- 
## Integration with Spring Boot:

This Unity project is connected to a Spring Boot backend, which exposes RESTful APIs for managing users and weapons. You can use the API to fetch user or weapon data, update weapon statistics, and delete entries.

For the backend code and further details, you can refer to the [Spring Boot Repository](https://github.com/Muhammet933321/SpringBootAPI.git).
